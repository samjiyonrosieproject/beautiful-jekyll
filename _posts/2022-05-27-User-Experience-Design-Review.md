# MannConnect

Sam Korff, Rosie Potash, Jiyon Chatterjee all contributed to all facets of this project.

## Problem Definition and Proposed Solution Overview

At Horace Mann, the interaction among different grades in the high school is stunted, either by anxieties or unwillingness to connect. Our app, Mann Connect, offers a means of connection through collaboration. In our app, users enter their classes and are added to a chat that is composed of current members as well as past members. In the chat, monitored by honor council members, Horace Mann students can help each other through challenging courses. This enforces cross-grade interaction in a less forced, more helpful manner. 

## Contextual Inquiry Results & Key Tasks

We chose to conduct an interview with a teacher instead of a contextual inquiry since our presence could have altered the actions of the students in the advisory. Furthermore, we would have to miss our own advisory period. Additionally, since we only had break period, which lasts 15 minutes, to conduct the interview, it was easier to do that than a more complex form of inquiry that required explanation. An interview was easy because everyone understands what an interview is because they are so mainstream. 
Older students feel a sense of responsibility in their interactions with younger students because of their understanding of how challenging the times of the younger students were. Horace Mann gives students an immense amount of work and stress, and the shared experience of that ordeal causes most older students to be kind and welcoming to younger students. Although there is an expectation from teachers that older students will guide younger students, older students feel that responsibility on their own because of all of the things they wish they had known at that age. Furthermore, there are a variety of factors that influence which older students younger students gravitate to, including gender, shared classes, and shared interests. Finally, in order to improve relationships between grades, upperclassmen need to have the agency of starting casual conversations with underclassmen to decrease the intimidation factor.

## Initial Paper Prototype

We chose the design that allows students to connect with each other through an app that lets them discuss teachers and courses with students who previously had those teachers or courses. This design received the most positive feedback in looking back at our design critiques, and since our peers are the people for whom we are making this design, we took their feedback very seriously. We chose the task of Working/Hanging Out with Students in the Library From Different Grades because the library is the heart of the Horace Mann Upper Division since students from all grades congregate there. However, students don’t usually congregate between grades, which they could do by discussing old courses with older students helping younger students understand the material. Furthermore, we chose the task of Being Less Judgemental of Other Grades, because incorrect preconceptions about other grades is one of the essential barriers to cross grade communication and engagement. Cross-grade interaction in the library is one of the two most important tasks we came up with because the library is the heart of the upper division experience and is one of the most universal parts of the Upper Division. Furthermore, making students less judgemental of other grades is crucial because if people have negative initial impressions of other grades, that can be a difficult barrier to overcome in cross grade interactions.

## Usability Testing Process & Results

Our first usability test took place in Katz Library with a junior who is not taking our class. This was a junior who has been at the school since the 3s and is an active member of the community who participates in a variety of clubs and classes. We chose this participant to represent the Upper Division because the high school itself has elected them to represent them since they are a member of the community council. We chose to conduct the usability test in the library because it is a space in which high schoolers spend a large part of their time and they would likely be using our app in that space. The procedure for the test was that we opened the app for the junior and gave them some tasks to complete, such as asking a question about their class and looking at class assignments. We directed the junior through the tasks while taking notes on any feedback the junior had. We made some changes to our protopype as  a result of this usability test; for example, we added a screen for students to submit their schedule and a place for them to search through other classes to see what people said about different classes and what classes they would want to take.
The following were recurring issues in the usability testing that were severe enough to warrant fixing:
Uncertainty about what to do after a loading screen - We changed our design so that the “welcome page” automatically faded into the login page, so that users would not be confused about where to click on the screen
Uncertainty about how the app knows what your schedule is - We created a page after the login that asks the user to upload their schedule to accurately tailor their profile
Unable to go from the login screen to the next screen - Fixed the green buttons below the login panels so that the user can move to the next page

## Final Paper Prototype and Initial Digital Mockup
In our final paper prototype, we focused on removing barriers between grades by means of a discussion and information forum for HM Upper Division courses. In the search bar, the user could enter a teacher or course at Horace Mann. After entering their search, the user would be presented with an array of group chats titled by their preferred course. By clicking on the course the student belongs to, they enter a group chat composed of any existing Horace Mann student that is either currently taking the course or formerly completed it. As a current student in that class, they would benefit from the advice of students who have already taken the course. When a student finishes the class, the student can remain in the chat, but their role would now be to give advice to others. While the premise of this system is based on academics, the conversation in the chat could naturally evolve into more casual interactions. Grappling with challenging academics and navigating relationships with teachers are experiences that every single Horace Mann student can relate to. This basis of academic commonalities provides the potential for casual cross grade interaction.

We adapted this paper prototype to a digital prototype in Figma. One of the most important modifications made to our prototype during this process was that we gave our users the ability to search for classes they were interested in. This revision was necessary because one of the times when underclassmen most frequently want to talk to upperclassmen is when they are deciding their schedules and are curious about new classes. Thus, being able to search for these classes and see who has taken them allows the under and upperclassmen to connect. Another critical addition to our design was that we added a button for people to upload their schedule and thus automatically connect them to their peers without making them input each class one by one. If we make it easier for people to use our app it is more likely that they will use it.
