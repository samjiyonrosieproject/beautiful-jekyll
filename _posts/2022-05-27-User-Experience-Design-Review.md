# MannConnect

Sam Korff, Rosie Potash, Jiyon Chatterjee all contributed to all facets of this project.

## Problem Definition and Proposed Solution Overview

At Horace Mann, the interaction among different grades in the high school is stunted, either by anxieties or unwillingness to connect. Our app, Mann Connect, offers a means of connection through collaboration. In our app, users enter their classes and are added to a chat that is composed of current members as well as past members. In the chat, monitored by honor council members, Horace Mann students can help each other through challenging courses. This enforces cross-grade interaction in a less forced, more helpful manner. 

## Contextual Inquiry Results & Key Tasks

We chose to conduct an interview with a teacher instead of a contextual inquiry since our presence could have altered the actions of the students in the advisory. Furthermore, we would have to miss our own advisory period. Additionally, since we only had break period, which lasts 15 minutes, to conduct the interview, it was easier to do that than a more complex form of inquiry that required explanation. An interview was easy because everyone understands what an interview is because they are so mainstream. 
Older students feel a sense of responsibility in their interactions with younger students because of their understanding of how challenging the times of the younger students were. Horace Mann gives students an immense amount of work and stress, and the shared experience of that ordeal causes most older students to be kind and welcoming to younger students. Although there is an expectation from teachers that older students will guide younger students, older students feel that responsibility on their own because of all of the things they wish they had known at that age. Furthermore, there are a variety of factors that influence which older students younger students gravitate to, including gender, shared classes, and shared interests. Finally, in order to improve relationships between grades, upperclassmen need to have the agency of starting casual conversations with underclassmen to decrease the intimidation factor.

## Initial Paper Prototype



We chose the design that allows students to connect with each other through an app that lets them discuss teachers and courses with students who previously had those teachers or courses. This design received the most positive feedback in looking back at our design critiques, and since our peers are the people for whom we are making this design, we took their feedback very seriously. We chose the task of Working/Hanging Out with Students in the Library From Different Grades because the library is the heart of the Horace Mann Upper Division since students from all grades congregate there. However, students donâ€™t usually congregate between grades, which they could do by discussing old courses with older students helping younger students understand the material. Furthermore, we chose the task of Being Less Judgemental of Other Grades, because incorrect preconceptions about other grades is one of the essential barriers to cross grade communication and engagement. Cross-grade interaction in the library is one of the two most important tasks we came up with because the library is the heart of the upper division experience and is one of the most universal parts of the Upper Division. Furthermore, making students less judgemental of other grades is crucial because if people have negative initial impressions of other grades, that can be a difficult barrier to overcome in cross grade interactions.
