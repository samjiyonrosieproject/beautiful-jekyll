## Contextual Inquiry Review

### Key Takeaways:

Older students feel a sense of responsibility in their interactions with younger students because of their understanding of how challenging the times of the younger students were. Horace Mann gives students an immense amount of work and stress, and the shared experience of that ordeal causes most older students to be kind and welcoming to younger students. Although there is an expectation from teachers that older students will guide younger students, older students feel that responsibility on their own because of all of the things they wish they had known at that age. Furthermore, there are a variety of factors that influence which older students younger students gravitate to, including gender, shared classes, and shared interests. Finally, in order to improve relationships between grades, upperclassmen need to have the agency of starting casual conversations with underclassmen to decrease the intimidation factor.


### Inquiries:


#### Inquiry 1: Horace Mann Math Teacher
We interviewed a veteran Horace Mann math teacher who has an advisory and has had advisories with multiple different grades in their classroom during break. We asked questions about the divisions between grades and the variety of ways the teacher encounters those divisions. We learned that it is easier for an advisor to form a sense of community when all the kids are in one grade, but there is more of a sense of continuity between grades and more perspective when you have students of different ages in your advisory. When there are students of different grades, there is a general sense of heterogeneity, but in that heterogeneity, there is an aspect of homogeneity. One way advisors can help with advisory unity is by explicitly telling their older students that they should be helping the younger students and giving them advice. Every grade has checkpoint moments, such as sophomore spring, when you decide which classes you want to take in junior year. In these moments, older students can help younger students by talking to them about their choices as well as the consequences they are currently experiencing as a result of those decisions. Juniors and seniors are most similar in terms of the teaching style used by teachers, demonstrating that the division is not only social, but also academic. The academic division makes sense, since students are at different stages of academic development. Sometimes the stereotypical relationships between senior boys and freshman girls actually happen, and that relationship can be immensely problematic.

#### Inquiry 2: Sophomore Boy approaching Junior
We performed a contextual inquiry with a sophomore student at HM who was sitting alone in a corner of the cafeteria. We approached this student because we knew he was not one of the more extroverted underclassmen, meaning that observing his organic interactions with older students would give us better insight into how the average 10th grader might approach an upperclassmen. We conducted this interview in the cafeteria during F period, which is a common lunch period for many Upper Division students, and we chose the cafeteria as a setting because, along with the library, it is the most popular social setting for students. We asked the sophomore to choose any older student to approach and start a conversation with, so he decided to walk up to a male junior a few tables away. We asked him why he chose to approach this student, and he answered that it was the closest table and he seemed friendly. We noted that he chose someone of the same gender to speak to, which is interesting when considering what type of people the underclassmen are comfortable approaching. His conversation starter consisted of a “what’s-up,” after which the conversation was mostly driven by the older student, who asked the sophomore a series of questions mostly related to classes at school. Although the junior was very warm and friendly, trying to discuss shared interests in ceramics classes and the sophomore’s MIT sweatshirt, the conversation was definitely somewhat stilted due to it being a very wooden question-and-answer format. The age and maturity gap was definitely very stark, with the upperclassmen assuming most of the responsibility for keeping the interaction going (even though he didn’t initially know that he’d been approached for a contextual inquiry). 

##### Inquiry 3: Freshman Girl approaching Junior
For our last contextual inquiry, we interviewed a freshman student. We began the inquiry by walking alongside the freshman, and let her choose where the interview would occur, either the cafeteria or the library. She chose the cafeteria over the library. When we walked in, we asked her where she would like to sit. She said the middle of the cafeteria, at the round tables. When we saw the round tables were too crowded, we sat at the rectangular tables by the exit. When we asked her why she would rather sit at the round tables, and if she usually sits there, she said she usually sat there because it was more of a social space for the freshmen class. As we inquired about other freshmen “hang out spots” around the campus, she mentioned the library. We asked her where in the library she would gravitate towards. She excluded locations that upperclassmen commonly reside in, such as the section of computers, and the row of desks in the middle of the library. As our conversation veered to other topics about classes and teachers, we asked her to approach a junior we had planted at a different table. She was hesitant and wanted to know why. When we asked her why she did not want to, she said it would be “awkward.” We understood why she felt this way, because talking to someone you are not familiar with can provoke uncomfortable feelings. When we asked her if she would have approached a freshman she was not familiar with, she said she would still feel uncomfortable doing it, but would still be able to do it. She said it was “intimidating” that the junior was older and looked “busy” when the junior was simply sitting and looking at her phone. She felt that she shouldn’t bother the junior, simply because she was a junior, and how she interprets juniors and other upperclassmen. 

### Themes & Process:
We chose to conduct an interview with a teacher instead of a contextual inquiry since our presence could have altered the actions of the students in the advisory. Furthermore, we would have to miss our own advisory period. Additionally, since we only had break period, which lasts 15 minutes, to conduct the interview, it was easier to do that than a more complex form of inquiry that required explanation. An interview was easy because everyone understands what an interview is because they are so mainstream. Three main takeaways from interview were: 1) Older students are expected to give advice to younger students as a main form of interaction 2) Juniors and seniors are the most similar grades in high school 3) Having an advisory of all one grade is beneficial because everyone is experiencing the same things, but an advisory of varying grades can also be useful to provide a sense of continuity through grades. Some themes we observed were that upper and lower classmen are seen incredibly differently by faculty because they are different in terms of academic and social progress. Being seen as different by the faculty who shape our school leads upper and lower classmen to develop mentor and advice relationships more than genuine friendships. When interviewing students, we chose a sophomore boy and freshman girl in order to acquire different demographics. Since we are all juniors, and juniors and similars are relatively similar, we thought it was important to interview both sophomores and freshmen. We chose the cafeteria because it is the place with the largest draw to socialization. By observing the cafeteria, we can see social interactions in their natural state. The three main takeaways from the inquiry of the sophomore were: 1) Older students seem to feel more responsibility in keeping an interaction going with younger students, 2) Underclassmen seem more comfortable approaching friendly-appearing high schoolers of the same gender, and 3) Students of different grades seem to naturally gravitate towards discussing classes and school rather than other social topics. One theme we observed was that a variety of factors plays a role in whether students feel comfortable interacting with people from other grades including gender, shared classes, and whether the upperclassmen seems open to having a conversation. Additionally, upperclassmen feel a sense of responsibility and duty to the underclassmen as demonstrated by their carrying of the conversation. When we interviewed the students, we attempted to keep the feel of the conversation casual. The environment of the interviews were a factor in this process, as more casual environments made the conversations feel less structured. In most instances we had to steer the conversation, which made the inquiry somewhat unnatural. Some takeaways from our third inquiry were that although a facilitated conversation may feel unnatural it has the potential to be a genuine interaction when both people overcome their own awkward feelings. It is important for upperclassmen to recognize their image as generally “intimidating” when approaching underclassmen. If upperclassmen sparked more casual interactions with underclassmen, freshmen and sophomores would generally feel less hesitant to speak to upperclassmen. When hesitancy and nerves are eliminated from these interactions, there is potential for genuine connection.
