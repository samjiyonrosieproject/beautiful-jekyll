## Usability Testing Lab

#### Introduction to our Design Choice:
We chose the design that allows students to connect with each other through an app that lets them discuss teachers and courses with students who previously had those teachers or courses. This design received the most positive feedback in looking back at our design critiques, and since our peers are the people for whom we are making this design, we took their feedback very seriously. Furthermore, we felt that this app would be somewhat technically challenging and would allow us to improve our coding skills while still being feasible. We chose the task of Working/Hanging Out with Students in the Library From Different Grades because the library is the heart of the Horace Mann Upper Division since students from all grades congregate there. However, students don't usually congregate between grades, which they could do by discussing old courses with older students helping younger students understand the material. Furthermore, we chose the task of Being Less Judgemental of Other Grades, because incorrect preconceptions about other grades is one of the essential barriers to cross grade communication and engagement.
